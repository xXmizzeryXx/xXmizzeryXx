## About me
I'm a web developer and student who enjoys building practical tools and learning by doing. I create projects that solve real problems (and sometimes bend the rules), and I’m always sharpening my coding skills and trying new tech.

- 🔭 Current focus: improving web development skills, learning best practices, contributing to projects
- 🌱 Learning: deeper JavaScript, backend concepts, deployment and security fundamentals
- ⚡ Fun fact: I build small tools and proxies to experiment with networking and web tech
